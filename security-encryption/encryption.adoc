For this lab you'll do some encryption and hashing to

These activities will work best if you partner with someone to send encrypted messages back and forth.

== Learning Objectives

- How to encrypt a volume with Veracrypt
- How to encrypt a single file with (tool)
- How to use a hash to verify file integrity
- Possible - rot13
- Python?

== Hashing

== Simplest Encryption: Rot13

Rot13 is an easy to use "encryption" tool that barely counts as encryption at all.
It would really only fool the least determined attackers, because anyone who knows anything about encryption would probably think to try Rot13, and might even recognize it on sight.
It is sometimes used on web forums to "hide" spoiler information when discussing movies or video games, so that people don't accidentally learn something they didn't want to learn.

Rot13 is a simple Caesar cipher.
The idea behind a Caesar cipher is to shift letters of the alphabet when writing the message.
If you were doing the simplest Caesar cipher by shifting letters by 1 position, A becomes B, B becomes C, ... and Z becomes A.
To "decrypt" a message encoded with a Caesar cipher, you just need to know the key, or the number of characters to shift.
Then you can take the message and unshift the characters back to what they should be: B -> A, C -> B, A -> Z, etc.

Rot13 is a Caesar cipher where you shift letters by 13 positions.
It works very conveniently in the English alphabet because we have 26 letters.
Half of 26 is 13, and so with Rot13 you encode messages by shifting them by half the alphabet: A -> N, B -> O, Z -> M.
With any shift besides 13, you need to do a separate reversal operation to decode the message.
The nice thing about Rot13 is that, in order to shift back, you can simply run Rot13 over the message again.

Let's say I wanted to send a secret message and don't want anybody to read it.
We'll start with a secret message:

.Secret message
----
This is my super secret message.

If I run Rot13 over my message, I get the following:

.Rot13 encoded message

Create your own encoded message by going to http://www.rot13.com and entering some text.
Send a rot13 encoded message to someone.
