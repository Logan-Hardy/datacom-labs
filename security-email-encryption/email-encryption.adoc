For this lab, you will use public key encryption to send and receive encrypted emails.
To send and receive encrypted emails requires that both you and your communication partner have created a public and private _key pair_ and have shared your *public* keys with each other.
The private key in a key pair should always be kept private (hence the name).
If you do not have another communication partner, or are completing this for one of my courses, you can send me an encrypted email at ryan@schuetzler.net.
You can find my public key next to the little key icon at https://keybase.io/rschuetzler.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you will have a better understanding of the following ideas:

- How to send and receive encrypted email
- How a public and private key pair can be used
- How to digitally sign an email message
- What encryption and digital signatures do

== Instructions

For this lab, we will use a browser extension called https://www.mailvelope.com/en/[Mailvelope] to encrypt and decrypt messages directly from the browser. 
https://www.mailvelope.com/en/[Mailvelope] is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows you to use PGP keys in popular webmail clients like Gmail.
It integrates directly into the user interface of your favorite mail client so you can send and read encrypted emails.

=== Setting up Mailvelope
. Make sure you are using either the Chrome or Firefox web browser. Mailvelope only works with those two. I use Chrome, so the tutorial steps here will be for that. Steps in Firefox should be pretty similar.
. Go to https://www.mailvelope.com/en/ and click the link on the page to install the extension for your browser.
. Click the extension's icon in your browser, then click "Let's Start!" at the bottom of the popup window. This should take you to the "Setup" tab of the Mailvelope extension.

[start=4]
. Click "Generate key" to create your first key pair.
.. Fill out all fields.
.. Make sure you select a unique password, as this will be used to make sure your private key stays private.
.. Optional: You may select the box to "Upload public key to Mailvelope Key Server" if you choose.

NOTE: A key server is used to distribute and share public keys.
Putting your public key on a key server just makes it easier for people to find your public key and encrypt messages to you.


You now have a working key pair that can be used to receive encrypted email, or digitally sign your outgoing messages.

=== Sharing public keys

In order to send an encrypted message to someone with public key encryption like what we are using here, you need your recipient's public key.
For others to send you encrypted message, they will need your public key.
One way to share public keys is to place them on the key server as we talked about in the step above.
You could also post the public key on your website to provide some proof that the key belongs to you.
Another option is just to send them in an email.

==== Exporting your key

WARNING: Remember to *_never_* share your private key.
Be careful when you are exporting your keys that you only export your public key.
Don't make the mistake https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/23/adobe-security-team-posts-public-key-together-with-private-key/[Adobe made].

[start=5]
. Go to the "Key Management" tab and click the key you want to export.
. Click the "Export" button.
. Before you export, make sure you only select "Public"!
. Click "Save" to download your public key.
. Share the public key with whoever you are wanting to send messages to you. You can share the key through email, a flash drive, or any other way that you would share a file. You could even post it on your website so the whole world can know the public key belongs to you.

==== Importing another key

To send encrypted messages, you need to have the recipient's public key.
Once you have a text-friendly form of their public key, you can import it into Mailvelope.
You can do that either as a file or by copying the text.
My public key is available at https://keybase.io/rschuetzler/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=565df5e50b4ca56c8c08aadfd149ca54b652a40f

[start=10]
. On the "Key Management" tab of Mailvelope, click "Import"
. Import the public key
.. If the user has shared their key with you as a text file (usually ending with a `.asc` file extension), click "Select a key text file to import", find the key file, and import it.
.. If you have found the key somewhere else (like mine linked above) and just want to copy the raw text in, you can use the "Import key as text" field to paste the key.
.. If the key is on a key server you can use the box for Key search to search several different key servers.

WARNING: Be careful with trusting unknown public keys, as anyone can create a public key with any name or email address.
A key server does not perform any identity proofing of the keys, so you could create a key claiming to be Ben Affleck just as easily as you could for your own name.
Just because you find a public key with someone's name on a key server does not mean the key actually belongs to that person.

==== Sending encrypted and signed mail

Now that you have your own key pair and the public key of your desired recipient, you are ready to send an encrypted message.
I'll be using Gmail as an example here, but Mailvelope works for others, including Outlook.com and Yahoo.

[start=12]
. Open your email inbox. If it was already open, make sure you refresh the page so Mailvelope's integration can load.
+
TIP: If you're in Gmail, Mailvelope helpfully offers to integrate directly into your mailbox, allowing you click a button in Gmail to send a secure email. You do not have to do this, but you can if you want.
. Click the button to compose a new message.
. You will see a small compose button pop up in your new mail window

image::mailvelope-compose.png[Compose button]

[start=15]
. Select the recipient of your message (e.g., ryan@schuetzler.net)
.. If your intended recipient is not showing up, make sure you have imported their public key.

NOTE: You must select all recipients in the Mailvelope Compose window or they will not be able to read the encrypted message.
If you select other recipients in the regular email window, they will receive an encrypted message that they cannot decrypt.

[start=16]
. Click the "Options" button at the bottom of the window, and check the box to "Sign message with key".
. Click the "Encrypt" button.
. Enter the password for your private key.

You should see a whole bunch of gobbledygook in a new mail window starting with `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----`. This is your PGP encrypted message. Select a recipient, give the mail a subject line, send it.

NOTE: Mailvelope might put in `rschuetzler@keybase.io` as my email address. When you go to send the message, change the destination address to `ryan@schuetzler.net` or I won't receive your email.

==== Reading encrypted mail

When you receive an encrypted message, it is a simple process to read it.

[start=19]
. Open the email as usual in your browser.
. Mailvelope will detect that it is an encrypted message and display a pop-over allowing you to click to decrypt the message.
.. You may need to enter the password for your private key again. That is because the private key is used to decrypt a message destined for you.

[start=21]
. Read the encrypted message in your browser window
. In the top right you can see if the message has been digitally signed. You can also click "Signed digitally" to view the key that was used to sign the message.

== Things to think about
. What are the benefits of encrypting emails?
. What are the drawbacks of encrypting emails?
. What information is still visible (e.g., to your email provider or ISP) when the contents of an email are encrypted?
