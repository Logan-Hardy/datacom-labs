The two most common transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP.
While both protocols have a few things in common, like ports, they are very different in the way that they operate.
In this exercise you will look at the differences in the way the two protocols operate as they send both short and long messages to their destination.

== Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of the following terms:

* TCP
* UDP
* Ports

=== Install Wireshark

.  If you haven't already, go to https://www.wireshark.org/download.html and download the appropriate version of Wireshark for your _host_ operating system
.  Run the installer to install both Wireshark and the packet capture driver (`winpcap` for Windows)

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-  Explain the differences between TCP and UDP
-  Use Wireshark to view and analyze TCP and UDP data streams
-  Use `netcat` to send messages on a network

== Steps

In this section, the "host" refers to your computer. "Guest" refers to
the virtual machine running inside your computer.

=== Initialize VMs

* Create a new folder on your computer for this exercise.
* Copy the `Vagrantfile`, `bootstrap.sh`, and `dangerous.txt` from the lab materials to the directory
* Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder.
** (Remember Start > cmd [enter], `cd`, `md`)
* Run `> vagrant up` to initialize the virtual machines for this lab.
** The two machines you'll be using here are named `alice` and `bob`.
** This step may take a little bit as software is installed for this lab.
* Open a second terminal and navigate to the same directory. You'll need connections to both Alice and Bob simultaneously.

=== Gather information

* In one terminal, connect to Alice with `> vagrant ssh alice`. 
* From the other, connect to Bob with `> vagrant ssh bob`.

NOTE: This lab creates two different VMs with different IP addresses. By adding `alice` or `bob` to the end of the `vagrant ssh` command, you are telling the vagrant command which VM you want to connect to. They are named `alice` and `bob` in the Vagrantfile.

* To use the `tshark` program, you need to know the name of the interfaces you'll be using.  
On each VM, run the command `$ ifconfig`, then look at the results of the command. 
The interface we'll be using for this lab is the one with the `inet addr` on the 192.168.100.0 subnet. 
The interface name is on the left. 
wIn the screenshot below, and throughout this lab, you'll see `enp0s8`. 
*Substitute your own interface name whenever you see that value in a command.*

* Determine the IP address of the appropriate interface of each VM. Record
the IP addresses in the assignment submission, and keep them handy.
You'll need them soon.

=== Examining short messages in UDP

* `tshark` is a version of Wireshark designed to run on the command line.
* To install `tshark` on alice, you'll need to run the command on the following line.  
You can examine the `bootstrap.sh` file to see what it does.  
Simply put, it fetches the latest version of the package repository for Ubuntu and installs `tshark`.  
Then it changes permissions on one file which will allow you to run `tshark` without being an administrator or `sudo`.
** When presented with the dialog asking 'Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?': Select `<Yes>`

 $ sudo bash /vagrant/bootstrap.sh

* *Before executing any commands at this stage, review the entire section.*
Once you start `tshark`, you'll have a limited amount of time to complete the other steps, so you want to be ready for them.
It may even be wise to try running the `netcat` commands on each machine to make sure you understand them, then do it again with `tshark` running to get the packet capture.
* The following is the command to run the `tshark` program in the background so we can complete the other commands. 
You should change the `duration:[number]` option to a number of seconds. 
This is how long (in seconds) `tshark` will run before automatically stopping and saving the capture to a file. 
Give yourself plenty of time, but not so long that you have to wait a long time for the program to finish its job.
** `-f "not broadcast and not multicast and not arp"` filters all packets that are not sent directly to the computer doing the capture.
** `-i enp0s8` tells tshark to capture packets on the `enp0s8` interface, which in this case is the network interface connecting Alice and Bob. 
Use `ifconfig` or `tshark   -D` to get a list of possible network interfaces.
** The `-a duration:30` option tells tshark to run for 30 seconds before automatically finishing its capture (adjust this time as necessary to give yourself enough time to finish typing all of the `netcat` commands before the capture quits).
** The `-w /vagrant/udp.pcap` option tells tshark to save the output of the capture to the file `/vagrant/udp.pcap`.
** The `-Q` option tells tshark to do its capture quietly, without any output to the terminal. This is important due to the next command...
** `&` at the end of any Linux command tells it to run in the background. 
This will allow us to execute other commands while the capture is running.

NOTE: The `\` in the following command is only needed because this command spans two lines in the print version of the lab.
If you type it out in one line, you can omit the `\` after `duration:30`.
The backslash tells the shell that you're going to keep typing parts of the command on the next line.

 $ tshark -f "not broadcast and not multicast and not arp" -i enp0s8 \
 -a duration:30 -w /vagrant/udp-short.pcap -Q &

* Start wireshark (with `tshark` on Alice)
* Use `netcat` to set up listening on a UDP port on Alice.
** The `-u` tells netcat we'll be using UDP.
** Finally, `-l 4242` tells netcat to listen on port 4242.

 $ netcat -ul 4242

* Use netcat to send a UDP message to Alice from Bob
* Enter the following command at Bob's command prompt to open a
connection to Alice, substituting Alice's IP address where indicated
(remove the `<>`).

 $ netcat -u <Alice's IP Address> 4242

* Once the connection has started, type a brief message (1 or 2 sentences) and hit kbd:[Enter] to send.
* After the message is sent, hit kbd:[CTRL+C] on Bob to end the `netcat` connection. 
Switch over to Alice and type kbd:[Ctrl+C] again to stop netcat from listening. 
Wait for your `tshark` session to end (at whatever time limit you set).

=== Examining UDP in Wireshark

On your host computer, open up a file browser (e.g. Windows Explorer) and find the directory you created for this lab. 
There you should find a file named `udp-short.pcap`. 
This file should contain all of the packets sent between Alice and Bob while your tshark session was running. 
Open that file in Wireshark.

Review the following questions:

* How many packets are sent across the network to send a message with UDP?
* How many total bytes are sent? This is the Length column of the Wireshark output, or the "bytes on wire" number for the frames.
* Inspect the data in the packet in the Wireshark output. Can you see your message? Can you see the IP, TCP, and Ethernet headers?
* What port is the destination and what is the source? Remember you are seeing all traffic from Alice's perspective because that is the system doing the packet capture.

=== Examining TCP

Now we will send a short message (the same short message as before)
using TCP instead of UDP.

* Start `tshark` again, changing the name of the output file to `/vagrant/tcp-short.pcap`. 
This is important, because you may want to review the UDP and TCP files to answer some of the questions in the submission.

 $ tshark -f "not broadcast and not multicast and not arp" -i enp0s8 \
 -a duration:30 -w /vagrant/tcp-short.pcap -Q &

* On Alice, run `$ netcat -l 4242` to start listening on port 4242
* On Bob, run `$ netcat <Alice's ip address> 4242` to open a connection.
** Type your short message and hit Enter to send.
** Type Ctrl-C to end your connection. 
Unlike with UDP, this will also close `netcat` on Alice.
* Wait for your `tshark` session to end.
* Open `tcp-short.pcap` in Wireshark on your host computer and use it to answer the questions in the submission file.

Review the following questions:

* How many packets are sent across the network to send a message with TCP?
* How many total bytes are sent? This is the Length column of the Wireshark output, or the "bytes on wire" number for the frames.
* Inspect the data in the packet in the Wireshark output. Can you see your message? Can you see the IP, TCP, and Ethernet headers?
* What port is the destination and what is the source? Remember you are seeing all traffic from Alice's perspective because that is the system doing the packet capture.
* What is different between the TCP and UDP captures? What is the same?

=== Longer messages

In this section we will use netcat to send the contents of a text file as if we had typed it. 
This will let us see how UDP and TCP handle sending and receiving longer messages.

* Open the `dangerous.txt` file you copied from the lab documents. 
It should contain the entire contents of the short story "The Most Dangerous Game" by Richard Connell. 
As long as it's in the same directory as your Vagrantfile, can access it on your Linux VMs at `/vagrant/dangerous.txt`.

==== UDP

* Start `tshark`, outputting to the file `/vagrant/udp-long.pcap`.

 $ tshark -f "not broadcast and not multicast and not arp" -i enp0s8 \
 -a duration:30 -w /vagrant/udp-long.pcap -Q &

* Start `netcat` on Alice listening for a UDP message (`-u`) on port
4242.
* On Bob, send the contents of the `dangerous.txt` file over UDP with
the following command:

 $ netcat -u 192.168.100.10 4242 < /vagrant/dangerous.txt

* You should see the contents of the file appear in Alice's terminal.
* Press kbd:[Ctrl+C] on both VMs to stop netcat, then wait for your tshark
session to end.
* Open `udp-long.pcap` in Wireshark on your host.

You will see some packets marked with a protocol of `IPv4`, and others with a protocol of `UDP`.
This happens because UDP packets are not small enough for IPv4 and Ethernet.
The large file is first broken up by UDP into segments with a maximum size of 65,507 bytes (the maximum UDP header field size for length &#8722; headers).
This is not small enough for Ethernet, which has a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 1500 bytes.
The IPv4 protocol knows this because it interacts directly with Ethernet, and does the fragmentation for it.
IPv4 therefore takes the UDP packet and breaks it up into fragments small enough to send across Ethernet, where they are reassembled on the destination computer.
Wireshark knows this, and presents us with both the individual IPv4 packets sent across the wire, and the reassembled UDP datagram.

* Inspect one of the `IPv4` packets. What data do you see there? How big is the payload (Data) field of the packet?
* Inspect one of the `UDP` packets. How big is the payload there?
* How many UDP datagrams did it take to send the whole story?
* How many IPv4 fragments did it take?
* What is different about sending a long file vs. a short message with UDP?
* Were any packets sent from Alice (192.168.100.10) to Bob (192.168.100.20)?

==== TCP

* Start `tshark` with the filename `/vagrant/tcp-long.pcap` as the
output.
* Start `netcat` on Alice listening for a _TCP_ message on 4242.
* On Bob, send the contents of `dangerous.txt` over TCP to Alice
* Wait for your `tshark` session to end, then open `tcp-long.pcap` in
Wireshark on your host.

[NOTE]
====
You will notice that unlike with UDP, you don't see any packets with the Protocol of `IPv4`. 
You may also notice that some of the TCP segments being sent across the network are larger than the 1500 byte size that Ethernet can handle.
So how does TCP send messages larger than the protocols below it can use?

It's actually a bit of cheating on the part of the Network Interface Card (NIC), the physical layer device that connects your computer (or VM) to the network. 
Segmentation work at the transport layer requires effort from the CPU of the sending computer.
In order to save effort and offload some of that processing onto the network card itself, computers can use Large Send Offload (LSO) and its sibling protocols TCP segmentation offload (TSO) and generic segmentation offload (GSO). 
Using these, the transport (and network) layers hand over large packets to the NIC, which can do the work of fragmenting, and adding headers.
If the receiving computer is set up the same way, it will do the same thing.
Our VMs are set up to use this shortcut, so for TCP transfers we see much larger packets than the MTU will allow.
The same shortcuts do not exist for UDP.

* How many packets were used to send the message with TCP?
* How many messages were sent from Alice to Bob (when Bob was sending the book to Alice)?
* What are the differences between UDP and TCP for longer messages?


=== Cleanup (Optional)

After submitting your work, you can destroy any boxes you used.

* Run `$ exit` to leave the SSH session. You will be back at your
regular command prompt.
* Run `> vagrant destroy` to turn off the machines and delete them
completely from your system. Answer `y` to confirm deletion.

== Questions to review

. What are the IP addresses of Alice and Bob?

[width=40%,options="header"]
|==============================
| VM name | IP address 
| Alice   |            
| Bob     |            
|==============================


=== UDP short message

[start=2]
. What are the source and destination ports of the UDP datagram?
. What are the source and destination IP addresses of the message?
. How many UDP packets did it take to send your short message (hint: only count packets
   captured that list UDP as the protocol)?
. How many total bytes (from all packets) were required to transmit this message (add up
   the "length" of all UDP packets)?
. How many bytes of data were sent (hint: click the packet in Wireshark and look at the
   "Data" section).

=== TCP short message

[start=7]
. What are the source and destination IP addresses of the message?
. What are the source and destination ports of the TCP datagram?
. How many TCP packets did it take to send your short message (hint: only count packets
   captured that list TCP as the protocol)?
. How many total bytes (from all packets) were required to transmit this message (add up
   the "length" of all TCP packets)?
. How many bytes of data were sent (hint: find the message in Wireshark and look at the
"Data" section).

=== TCP & UDP long messages

[start=12]
. The `netcat` program can be used to transfer the contents of files between
   machines. You transferred a large file to the stdout (aka the terminal) on Alice's
   computer using the `netcat [ip] [port] < filename.txt` syntax on Bob. If you had typed
   `netcat -l [port] > filename.txt` on Alice, that output would have gone into a
   file. Would TCP or UDP be better used for a file transfer like this, and why?
. How many packets did UDP take to send the message? What about TCP? Can you explain why?

=== Critical thinking

[start=14]
. What are two important differences between TCP and UDP when sending short messages?
. Why would someone choose to use TCP to send short messages (e.g. IRC for chat
   or SMTP for short emails)?
. Name a service that uses UDP, and explain why.
