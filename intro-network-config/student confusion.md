Issues from Lab 2
=================

* Student unfamiliar with `ifconfig`. More detailed description would probably
  be helpful.
* Make sure it's clear that on a Mac, and Linux, the ping command will continue
  forever unless you tell it to stop, or specify a certain number of pings in
  the command.
* Request for more screenshots in the instructions
* Need to make it OS-independent. Maybe specify that they can use a Windows VM
  to test out the Windows command-line tools. I had OS X students booting up
  bootcamp just to create the VMs so they could run all the stuff on
  Windows. That's not really necessary.
* Clarify what a "hop" is for the traceroute section


Notes for publication
=====================

* When we take this to the real-world, it would be nice to have either Word
  forms or something along those lines to make it easy to direct students where
  they need to fill things in. It also makes it easier to find student answers,
  and format their responses. I've never really gone all-out to make a Word form
  fillable, but I think it's what we want to do. Unless students don't own
  Word. Then maybe not...
