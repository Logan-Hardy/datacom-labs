= About This Book

This book is a work in progress.  The ultimate goal is to provide a set of
computer exercises that will allow anyone who is interested to get hands-on
experience with networking using modern technologies.

// = Required Equipment

// The only required equipment for the completion of these labs is a computer
// capable of running multiple 64-bit virtual machines.  Most of the instructions
// will assume you are using a Windows computer, but it is likely possible to
// complete all the exercises with some modification on Linux or macOS.

// Part of the goal of the book is to minimize software and hardware requirements
// to make it possible to gain practical networking experience without specialized
// networking hardware.  If you have access to enterprise grade switches, routers,
// and firewalls that you can practice with and configure, then there are likely
// other books that provide more instruction in that area.

= Introduction to Software Tools

[partintro]
--
Throughout these exercises you will be using several different software tools to
do your networking.  Several of these will be used across multiple labs.  These
general tools, like VirtualBox and WireShark, are introduced in the following
chapters.  This way you can get acquainted with the software before putting to
the test in the later exercises.
