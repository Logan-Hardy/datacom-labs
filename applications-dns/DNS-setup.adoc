The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the most critical parts of the Internet.
Companies also setup and configure their own DNS servers so that they can route intranet traffic.
In this exercise, you will set up a DNS server in Linux.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

.  Define the different types of DNS server (root, TLD, authoritative, resolving)
.  Explain how caching is used in DNS and the consequences of caching.
.  Configure an authoritative DNS server.
.  Configure a client to connect to a specific DNS server.

== Steps

=== Load the Preconfigured Vagrant File

Previously, when you ran `vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64`, Vagrant automatically generated a file named `Vagrantfile` (with no file extension).
This file contains the configuration options for your virtual machine.
For this exercise, a Vagrantfile has already been created.

* Copy the Vagrantfile for this exercise to a folder.
* Copy the `webminrepo.txt` and `nodns.txt` files to the same folder and rename them to have the `.sh` extensions instead of `.txt`. Accept the warnings that the file may become unusable
* Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the Vagrantfile.
* Run `vagrant up` to bring up the machines.
** Note that because two machines are defined in the Vagrantfile, any Vagrant command that does not target a specific machine will automatically target all machines.

Note that _two_ virtual machines will be created.
The machines are named "alice" and "bob."

=== Check Network Settings

* Run `> vagrant ssh alice` to connect to the first machine.
* Open a new command prompt, navigate to the folder with your Vagrantfile, and run `> vagrant ssh bob` to connect to the second machine.
* Run `$ ifconfig` to check the IP address and subnet of each machine.

TIP: There may be two ethernet connections.
This lab will focus on the one on the 192.168.100 network.
This is a bridged connection that allows multiple guests virtual machines to communicate with each other.
For the purposes of this exercise, you can pretend that the other network doesn't exist.

=== Setup Bob as an Authoritative DNS Server

BIND9 is a popular software package for DNS on Linux.
In can operate in 3 modes: 1) caching, 2) primary master, and 3) secondary master.
As a caching nameserver, BIND9 just remembers DNS information provided from other sources.
This is helpful because DNS queries take time, and the results don't change very often.
A caching DNS server stores the results of previous queries for a limited time (usually up to a day) and answers queries itself using the contents of the cache.
If no existing result for a query is in the cache, the caching server will send a request to the appropriate name servers.

As a primary master, BIND9 reads DNS information from a configuration file on the machine and resolves IP addresses.
As as secondary master, BIND9 resolves DNS information from another authoritative machine.
In this example we will setup Bob as a primary master.
That means that machines can query Bob for authoritative DNS information.

Consider the example of the website google.com.
If your computer has never connected to google.com, and your ISP has not cached google.com's IP address, you need to do a full DNS lookup.
The steps would look like
this.

.  Your computer uses the DNS protocol to query the resolving DNS server configured for your network.
.  The resolving DNS server checks its cache for google.com, cannot find it, so it queries the root DNS server for the `.com` top level domain (TLD).
.  The root nameserver gives the IP address for a `.com` TLD and sends it to the resolving nameserver.
.  The resolving nameserver queries the `.com` TLD and asks for google.com's authoritative nameserver.
.  The resolving nameserver queries google.com's authoritative nameserver for the IP address.
.  The resolving nameserver sends the IP address for google.com back to your computer.

Webmin is a web interface to administer various aspects of your system.
For this lab we will use Webmin to configure DNS in Bind9.
While it is possible to configure DNS entirely through the command line, the process is tedious and unforgiving. Small typos will break your configuration.
It is available through third-party repositories which were added to your VM when it booted.
Instructions for setting up Webmin on your own server are available https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-webmin-with-ssl-on-ubuntu-14-04[here].

* Run `> vagrant ssh bob`
* Change the password for the `ubuntu` user to something you will remember. Do this by typing `bob$ sudo passwd ubuntu`, then typing the new password two times. You will use this password to log into Webmin shortly.
* Run `bob$ sudo apt install bind9 webmin`
** This will download and install the bind9 software and webmin.
** Answer `y` when prompted to install.
* Run `bob$ cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local`
** This will print the DNS configuration. Currently, nothing is configured. The only lines in the configuration file are commented out (using `//`).
* Run `bob$ ifconfig` and verify the IP address for the 192.168.100.0 subnet (probably interface `eth1` or `enp0s8`)
* On your host computer, open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:10000`. Webmin runs a web server on port 10000.

IMPORTANT: This won't work if you don't use `https`

** You will likely get a warning that your connection is not private, or that there is an error with the certificate. In this case it is safe to ignore this error. The webmin server uses a self-signed certificate to encrypt your communications. This is not trusted by your host OS, so it displays the warning. Bypass the error and continue to localhost
* Sign into webmin with the username `ubuntu` and the password that you set a few steps ago.
* Under "Servers" in the menu on the left, select "BIND DNS Server". You will then see a large list of options and actions you can run on BIND.

TIP: If you don't see "BIND DNS Server" in the list of servers, click the "Refresh Modules" button at the bottom of the navigation menu.

* We will create two DNS Zones: first the forward zone, then the reverse zone. The forward zone converts names to IP addresses, while the reverse zone converts IP addresses back to names.
* Create the forward zone
** Under "Existing DNS Zones," select "Create master zone."
** Ensure that Zone type is Forward
** For Domain name, enter "example.com"
** For master server, enter "ns.example.com"
** For email address, enter "admin@example.com"
** Check the box to "Add NS record for master server?"
** Click Create
* Add records to the master zone
** On the "Edit Master Zone" screen, click "Address (0)". This is where we will add our A records for our subdomains.
** For Name, put "ns"
** For Address, put 192.168.100.25. This is the IP address of Bob's
computer, which is the DNS __name server__.
** Click Create.
** Do the same for the subdomain www, with the address 192.168.100.24
** Make sure you click Create before moving on.
** Click "Return to record types" at the bottom of the page.
* Add a reverse DNS Zone
** Click "Return to zone list" at the bottom of the record types page.
** Under Existing DNS Zones, click "Create master zone."
** Zone type: Reverse
** Domain name/Network: 192.168.100
** Master server: ns.example.com
** For email address, enter "admin@example.com"
** Click "Create"
* Add reverse DNS records to the zone
** Click "Reverse Address (0)"
** Create two reverse lookup records
*** Address: 192.168.100.24, hostname: www.example.com
*** Address: 192.168.100.25, hostname: ns.example.com
* Click "Return to zone list"
* Click "Apply Configuration" in the top right corner of the screen
* Check to see if your configuration is working
** Run `bob$ nslookup www.example.com 192.168.100.25` to run a DNS query on the machine.

TIP: the `nslookup` command is used to run DNS queries. The first argument (in this case, `www.example.com` is the address you want to look up. The second argument (`192.168.100.25`) is the DNS server you are using to look up the address.

** Run `bob$ nslookup ns.example.com 192.168.100.25` to query the
nameserver.
** Run a reverse lookup with `bob$ nslookup 192.168.100.24 192.168.100.25`. You should see that www.example.com resolves to that IP address.
** Run a reverse lookup with `bob$ nslookup 192.168.100.25 192.168.100.25`. You should see that ns.example.com resolves to that IP address.

=== Configure Alice to Point to Bob's DNS

Now we will set up Alice to use Bob as her DNS server.
Currently Alice is configured to use herself as a DNS server.

* First test the existing configuration. Run `alice$ nslookup www.example.com` or `alice$ nslookup ns.example.com` to see the IP addresses that resolve for those domains. This should not work, as `alice` was configured not to have a DNS server.
* Make Bob the DNS server by modifying the `/etc/netplan/50-vagrant.yaml` with the command `alice$ sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-vagrant.yaml` to say:

.Netplan configuration
[source,yaml]
----
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s8: # The name of your interface might be different than mine
      addresses:
      - 192.168.100.24/24
      nameservers:
        addresses: [192.168.100.25]
----

* Test your file to make sure you don't have any errors with the following command: `sudo netplan try`. If it says "Configuration accepted" after you hit enter, you can apply the change with `sudo netplan apply`.
* Run `alice$ nslookup ns.example.com` and `alice$ nslookup www.example.com` to see what the DNS server is, and what addresses are returned.

=== HOSTS file

In addition to DNS, you can manually set up host records for your local machine to make it easier to access commonly visited servers.
The easiest way is to add a record to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Linux/Mac, `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows). 
This is usually the first place your computer checks for host names (before even going to DNS), so records in your hosts file can be used to override DNS.

* First, try to ping Bob from Alice by typing `alice$ ping bob`. What is the result? Why?
* On Alice, open the hosts file with `alice$ sudo nano /etc/hosts`
* On the last line, add a line with Bob's IP address and the word "bob":

----
192.168.100.25  bob
----

* Save and close the file, now try to `ping bob`. What is the result now?
* Try to ping `google.com`. What is the result? What is Google's IP address?
* Now edit the hosts file again to include the following line:

 127.0.0.1  www.google.com

* Save and close the hosts file and ping google.com one more time. What IP address is pinged when you do this?

=== Cleanup (Optional)

After submitting your work, you can destroy any boxes you used.

* Run `$ exit` on Bob and Alice to leave the SSH sessions.
* Run `> vagrant destroy` to turn off the machines and delete them completely. Answer "y" to confirm deletion.
